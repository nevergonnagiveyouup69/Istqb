# Testing Overview

This document provides an overview of key testing concepts, including objectives, definitions, testing types, principles, and techniques.

## Objectives of Testing

- **Evaluation of Product Requirements:** Assessing that the product meets the documented needs.
- **Triggering Failures and Defects:** Intentionally causing error conditions to uncover issues.
- **Ensuring Required Convergence is Met:** Confirming that the integration of components meets the necessary criteria.
- **Reducing Risks:** Minimizing the probability and impact of defects.
- **Verifying Requirements are Met:** Checking that all specified requirements are fulfilled.
- **Verifying Compliance of Test Objects:** Ensuring that the test subjects conform to the set requirements.
- **Providing Information to Stakeholders:** Delivering clear and relevant testing results.
- **Building Confidence:** Instilling trust in the product’s quality.
- **Validation of Test Objectives:** Confirming that the testing goals have been achieved.

## Key Definitions

- **Root Cause:** The underlying reason for an error occurring.
- **Error:** A mistake made during the process, leading to an issue.
- **Defect:** An imperfection or fault in the product caused by an error.
- **Failure:** The event when defects are not corrected and the product does not perform as expected.

## Testing Types

- **Dynamic Testing:** Testing conducted when the product is in a quality assurance (QA) environment.
- **Static Testing:** Reviewing or inspecting the product artifacts (such as requirements or design documents) to find defects without executing code.

## Validation vs. Verification

- **Validation:** Evaluates whether the product will meet the user needs and other stakeholder requirements. It answers the question, "Are we building the right product?"
- **Verification:** Confirms that the product meets the specified requirements. It addresses, "Are we building the product right?"

## QA and QC

- **Quality Assurance (QA):** A process-focused approach that ensures the product development process is effective and can produce a quality product. Think of it as the "recipe" for making a good pizza—a good process helps create a good product.
- **Quality Control (QC):** A product-oriented approach where testing is a key component to validate the final output.

## Seven Testing Principles

1. **Testing Shows Presence of Defects:** Testing can show that defects exist, but not that they are absent.
2. **Exhaustive Testing is Impossible:** It is not feasible to test every possible scenario.
3. **Early Testing Saves Time and Money:** Detecting defects early in the development process reduces cost and effort.
4. **Defects Cluster Together:** A small number of modules usually contain most of the defects.
5. **Tests Wear Out:** Over time, tests may become less effective as the product evolves.
6. **Testing is Context Dependent:** The approach and techniques used in testing should be tailored to the specific context of the project.
7. **Absence of Errors is a Fallacy:** Even if no errors are detected, it does not guarantee that the product is error-free.

## Testing Techniques

- **Equivalence Partitioning:** A technique to divide input data into valid and invalid partitions to reduce the number of test cases while ensuring adequate coverage.
- **Boundary Value Analysis:** Focuses on testing the edges of input ranges where errors are more likely to occur.
